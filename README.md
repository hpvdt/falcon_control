# Control Board

This board is primarily meant to collect the inputs from the flight sticks over I2C and then operate control surface servos. In addition to this it also has the functionlity to read potentiometers on the control surfaces to verify the control surfaces are moving into the right position and even alerting the pilots if they fail to using a buzzer for attention and LEDs to specify the problematic surfaces.
